# We now have access to the EB_ENVIRONMENT variable, which we set up ourselves in the AWS console so that a given 
# environment (e.g., suitec-preview-service-dev) knows its own name. Extract the appropriate file from the zip previously
# downloaded and pipe it to local-production.json (since all our environments are running under NODE_ENV=production).
